The app also includes additional features such as multiple addresses, personal cart, order history, product reviews and ratings, and product search by name and category.

Karter uses Firebase Firestore as a remote database to store and manage all the grocery item details, user data, and order history. Firebase Firestore is used to store complex data, such as user and order data. Firebase provides a scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure for the app, making it easy to access data from any device and which works in a real-time.

This feature ensures that only registered users can access the app's features, such as placing orders and viewing order history. Firebase Authentication is an easy-to-use authentication service that handles user management.
